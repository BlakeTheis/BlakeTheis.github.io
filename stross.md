# Revisiting Predictions from Accelerondo by Charles Stross

## Human vs computer processing production
 > It's night in Amsterdam, morning in Silicon Valley. Today, fifty thousand human babies are being born around the world. Meanwhile automated factories in Indonesia and Mexico have produced another quarter of a million motherboards with processors rated at more than ten petaflops – about an order of magnitude below the lower bound on the computational capacity of a human brain. Another fourteen months and the larger part of the cumulative conscious processing power of the human species will be arriving in silicon. And the first meat the new AIs get to know will be the uploaded lobsters

Human brain estimate at time of writing > 100 petaflops .1 exaflop
Daily production 250,000 processors @10 petaflops - 2500 exaflops per day estimated at 25000 peoples processing power

"About 385,000 babies are born each day according to the UN. That adds up to more than 140 million a year." [source](https://www.theworldcounts.com/challenges/toxic-exposures/polluted-bodies/how-many-babies-are-born-a-day)
"These connections allow signals to travel between neurons and can function as logic gates, giving it a computing power of one exaflop—that is one quintillion mathematical operations per second (Madhavan, 2023)—that is a billion times a billion or 1 followed by 18 zeros." -[source](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/consciousness-and-beyond/202309/the-staggering-complexity-of-the-human-brain#:~:text=These%20connections%20allow%20signals%20to,1%20followed%20by%2018%20zeros.)
